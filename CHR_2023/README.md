# Dictionary vs Zeroshot

This repository contains links to datasets and code for the CHR-2023 Paper ["Death of the Dictionary? â€“ The Rise of Zero-Shot
Sentiment Classification"](https://discourse.computational-humanities-research.org/t/chr2023-conference/1978/2)

## Usage

### Prepare Data
This repository does not provide the datasets , but they can be downloaded here:

Holidaycheck, Filmstarts, PotTs and Sb10k can be downloaded from the [ Guhr et al. repository](https://github.com/oliverguhr/german-sentiment)\
[GermEval2017-Data](http://ltdata1.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/germeval2017/) \
Due to Copyright issues, the SCARE-dataset is not included and needs to be requested from the [authors]( https://www.romanklinger.de/scare/)\
[BBZ-Goldstandard](https://emporion.gswg.info/receive/emporion_mods_00000014). Note that the annotations in the annotations excel-file are aspect-based and need to be aggregated to the polar-sentiment\
[Lessing](https://github.com/lauchblatt/LessingSentimentEmotionCorpus)\
[German Noval Dataset](https://www.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/datascience/projects/nlp/kallimachos-concluded/german-novel-dataset/)\
[Amazon Review](https://huggingface.co/datasets/amazon_reviews_multi)\
[SentiLitKrit](https://github.com/dkltimon/SentiLitKrit_19-II)

To use the annotation scripts the datasets must be a feather-file. You can use the prepare_datasets.py for optimal shape 
### Dictionary annotation
In order to use the quantenda-script quanteda_senti.R install the required libraries and use the directory-structure to make it work. The needed wordlists are included, but are also freely available: [GPC](http://www.ulliwaltinger.de/sentiment/), [BPW](https://www.uni-giessen.de/de/fbz/fb02/forschung/research-networks/bsfa/textual_analysis/index), [SLK](https://github.com/dkltimon/SentiLitKrit_19-II/tree/master) ,[BAWL-R](https://www.ewi-psy.fu-berlin.de/psychologie/arbeitsbereiche/allgpsy/Download/index.html). Senti-WS is already included in quanteda-sentiment. 


### Install

MLMC uses older Versions of Torch and HF Transformers, so an own (virtual) environments should be created created for those tests, we recommend using anaconda. 

To install MLMC use:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/JaBorst/mlmc
```
Additionaly the Hugginface Datasets library is need which can be installed via. We used version 2.14.4:

```bash
conda install -c huggingface -c conda-forge datasets
```



### Sentiment Prediction 
For the zeroshot prediction use the zero.py or zero_binary.py.\
The prediciton with the guhr pipe can be done with guhr_senti.py

#### Evaluation
all classification-reports can be found in the folder metrics/. It is possible to use the script eval_dict.py to create own classification reports.
